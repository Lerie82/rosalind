## About
Rosalind is a website that can help you learn Bioinformatics and Python. You can complete these problems using an online Python Playground by katacoda.com (https://www.katacoda.com/courses/python/playground). I normally create a file named **dataset**, which I put the test data into, then read the file into the python script.
